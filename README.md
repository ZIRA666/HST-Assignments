#Notes on threshold choice: 
After testing with different threshold parameters, I selected values of 0.5 for F336W and 0.3 for F555W for this dataset. 
Initial attempts using higher threshold values (e.g., threshold_factor=4.0 for my code resulted in fewer detectable stars, 
often below the target range of 2700-4000.

#AI Acknowledgment 
All the methods developed from the HST workshop in class, but some of my workshop code got several errors and 
incomplete steps that prevented running all the data, so I use AI assistance (Claude) to improve on how my code 
structure would look like and resolve any execution errors.
